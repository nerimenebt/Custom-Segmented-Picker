Hello there, I'm Neri and in this repository, I'll be posting the code for the Custom Segmented Picker that you see on my Instagram 
    [**@neri_iosdev**](https://www.instagram.com/neri_iosdev/).
    
This project will help you to create Custom Segmented Picker With Matched Geometry Animation.

I hope you'll learn something new and use this animation and concept to achieve great effects for your apps.
